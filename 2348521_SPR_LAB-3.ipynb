After capturing the audio, it sends the data to Google’s API to translate the speech into text. \n",

It also includes error handling for two major scenarios: (1) if the speech is not understood (e.g., unclear speech or poor recording conditions), and (2) if the system cannot connect to the Google API (e.g., due to network issues).\n",

This basic system can serve as a foundation for various voice-activated applications, though its performance can be impacted by noisy environments, poor audio quality, or latency in the speech recognition service."
